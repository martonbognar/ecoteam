title: Reducing print usage for department printers

A number of years ago, Jo Van Bulck initiated [an experiment](https://system.cs.kuleuven.be/cs/system/services/printers/jobsheets.pdf)
on the 4th floor to change the printer banner pages to reduce ink usage. This,
however, was never expanded, and all the other printers kept using the old,
color-heavy banner pages.

After a consultation with the system group, we learned that they use the colored
bars on the banner page for debugging purposes, periodically passing by the
printer rooms and checking the banner pages for problems with the printers. For
this reason, they were reluctant to get rid of them on all floors, like it has
worked on the 4th floor for the past 4 years.

Luckily, we managed to reach a compromise: the [new banner pages](https://system.cs.kuleuven.be/cs/system/services/printers/jobsheets-2021.pdf), that were implemented on all floors
in May 2021 use 55% less ink than before (`0.04090` coverage instead of `0.09141`).

We would like to thank Bart Swennen from the system group for the cooperation
and implementing this change.
