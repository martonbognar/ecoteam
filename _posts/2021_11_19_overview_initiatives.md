# Current initiatives and dreams

## Ecogarden
One of our main goals is to set up a eco garden near our building. The garden can be used by anyone for meetings, gatherings, gardening projects or just enjoying the green surroundings. For more information, have a look at the [Geogarden](https://geogardenleuven.wordpress.com/) webisite.
## Trash management and recycling
Recycling is important. However it is not always clear which trash goes in which bag. Therefore, we want to provide more information about the differnt trash bags and to add a green bag to the kitchen for organic waste such as food scraps and coffee grounds. 
## Promoting sustainable and fair trade food products
We want to reconsider the current cafeteria supplies and substitute them with fair trade and sustainable alternatvies: 
* Cow milk is not as healthy as you think and is not environmental-friendly (TODO: add sources by Vera,JT?). For this reason, we would like to provide an alternative plant-based milk
* Exchanging the tea, coffee and sugar for a fair trade kind
* We want to provide fresh fruit on a weekly basis. The [veggie bag](http://www.greenofficeforkuleuven.be/project/veggie-bag/) initiative of the green office delivers a suprise package of fruit every monday and support local farmers and sustainability. 

On the topic of food, we also want to encourage the use of reusable kitchenware. If you want to find out more about preventing food waste and sustainable food, check out the [Green Office's website](http://www.greenofficeforkuleuven.be/project/sustainable-foods/)
## Promoting the efficent use of energy at out department
* Take the stairs instead of using the elevator, it will both benefit the energy consumption of the building and your health.
* We are planning on taking on the lighting system in the hallways. Currently, the light does not turn off automatically and stays on for the whole weekend if no one switches it off. We want to think about a better way to manage the lights, for instance by using an automatic timer and/or changing the light bulbs to less energy-consuming ones.
* A regular defrosting of the freezer in the kitchen reduces the overall energy consumption of the fridge (TODO: source)
## Promoting the use of sustainable tools
We recommend using tools that are eco-friendly (and privacy-friendly). For instance Doodle's websites includes a bunch of trackers and ads, instead use [Framadate](https://framadate.org/abc/en/) or [Dudle](https://dudle.inf.tu-dresden.de/).
## Brainstorming sessions
Join us on our brainstorming sessions and tell us what you think would be a good way to make our department greener!
